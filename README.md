Clean Content
===

After the [London WordCamp in November of 2013](http://2013.london.wordcamp.org/), I got an idea for a theme. It would have to be as powerful (feature wise) as the standard WordPress themes (Twenty Thirteen, Twenty Fourteen) but without the complex looks of say Twenty Fourteen. Less bells and whistles and more focus on posts, words and images. I'm probably not doing a good job of explaining this but the theme's name "Clean Content" should speak for itself.

Clean Content is a WordPress theme based on the [_Underscores](http://underscores.me) starter theme.

Some of the key features are:

* Simple and content first design
* Responsive layout
* Customisable through the standard WordPress theme customiser

####Options

Clean Content works with the built-in WordPress theme customiser and you can see a live preview of the changes you make before saving theme. 

You can customise the following:

* Link Colour (a couple of the colours will also change along with this one: buttons, headings, text fields, etc)
* Background colour
* Show or hide the theme description (default: hide)
* Full sidebar control (Hide sidebar, sidebar on the left, sidebar on the right) (default: sidebar on the right)


#### Support

If you see any problems of bugs, feel free to make an issue on [Github](https://github.com/On-Edge/wp-clean-content), I'll try to solve them to the best of my abilities.

#### Down the road...

I've got a couple of extra features I want to get into this theme but they didn't make it into the 1.0 release (otherwise 1.0 would probably never got out...). Stay tuned...
