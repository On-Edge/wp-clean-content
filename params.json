{"name":"Wp-clean-content","tagline":"Clean Content","body":"Clean Content\r\n===\r\n\r\nAfter the [London WordCamp in November of 2013](http://2013.london.wordcamp.org/), I got an idea for a theme. It would have to be as powerful (feature wise) as the standard WordPress themes (Twenty Thirteen, Twenty Fourteen) but without the complex looks of say Twenty Fourteen. Less bells and whistles and more focus on posts, words and images. I'm probably not doing a good job of explaining this but the theme's name \"Clean Content\" should speak for itself.\r\n\r\nClean Content is a WordPress theme based on the [_Underscores](http://underscores.me) starter theme.\r\n\r\nSome of the key features are:\r\n\r\n* Simple and content first design\r\n* Responsive layout\r\n* Customisable through the standard WordPress theme customiser\r\n\r\n![](https://raw2.github.com/On-Edge/wp-clean-content/develop/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n####Options\r\n\r\nClean Content works with the built-in WordPress theme customiser and you can see a live preview of the changes you make before saving theme. \r\n\r\nYou can customise the following:\r\n\r\n* Link Colour (a couple of the colours will also change along with this one: buttons, headings, text fields, etc)\r\n* Background colour\r\n* Show or hide the theme description (default: hide)\r\n* Full sidebar control (Hide sidebar, sidebar on the left, sidebar on the right) (default: sidebar on the right)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Support\r\n\r\nIf you see any problems of bugs, feel free to make an issue on [Github](https://github.com/On-Edge/wp-clean-content), I'll try to solve them to the best of my abilities.\r\n\r\n#### Down the road...\r\n\r\nI've got a couple of extra features I want to get into this theme but they didn't make it into the 1.0 release (otherwise 1.0 would probably never got out...). Stay tuned...\r\n\r\n#### License\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
